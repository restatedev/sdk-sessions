# Prepare a release: bump every published package to <version>, commit and
# tag. Nothing is pushed: push the commit and the tag yourself (the script
# prints the command), which triggers .github/workflows/release.yml. That
# workflow checks the tagged commit, builds the addon for every platform,
# and publishes the packages to npm.
#
# The published packages are the workspace's packages without `private`:
# the libraries (packages/*) and the addon's package per platform
# (packages/sessions/npm/*). They are always released together, with the
# same version.
#
# Usage:
#   ./.tools/prepare-release.sh 0.2.0
#   ./.tools/prepare-release.sh 0.3.0-rc.1
