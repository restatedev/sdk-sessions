// OpenCode 2.2 agents in Restate virtual objects: OpenCode for each
// invocation, with its database beside the object's.
//
//   const coder = opencode.agent({ name: 'coder', workspace: (ctx) => `/work/${ctx.key}` });
//
// or a handler of an object of your own: `handlers: { chat: opencode.chat() }`,
// with options for each invocation: `opencode.chat(async (ctx) => ({ workspace }))`
//
// or, for more than a prompt:
//
//   review: (ctx, task) => withOpenCode(ctx, { tools }, async ({ prompt }) => [await prompt(task), await prompt('Review it')]),
//
// The model is `model`, MODEL, or else openai/gpt-6-sol, which OpenCode's
// own providers serve, with the provider's API key (such as OPENAI_API_KEY).
//
// OpenCode keeps the model's history in a database of the key's own, beside
// `ctx.db` (db.ts): OpenCode boots only on a database that is empty or its
// own. Each prompt is a turn of the object's conversation (../conversation.ts):
// what clients read, and how turns end. What OpenCode stores of a turn (the
// model's replies, the tools' results) is copied into the turn after each of
// OpenCode's commits, in a `ctx.db` transaction of its own, idempotently (by
// OpenCode's message and part ids), and caught up before each publish, the
// answer, and any close of the turn. OpenCode boots lazily, as a turn runs:
// an answered prompt's retry boots nothing.
//
// OpenCode records an execution claim as a turn starts, and every boot sweeps
// the claims left behind. Whose claim it is comes from `ctx.db`: the last
// prompt submitted to OpenCode is recorded there before its submit
// (`restate_agents_opencode`). A boot for that prompt (a retried attempt)
// resumes its turn, as OpenCode does; a boot for any other closes it without
// asking the model (OpenCode's resume budget, `maxAttempts: 0`), and the sweep
// is awaited before anything is submitted. A retried attempt whose turn holds
// its final reply (copied, or caught up from OpenCode before the boot that
// would resume) answers with it: OpenCode's turn is closed, not resumed, which
// would ask the model again. A turn another invocation left
// (killed) is closed in OpenCode first, then the copy catches up, then the
// conversation closes it (`settleOwn` of the items). The next prompt tells the
// model how the turn before it ended, and which of its calls did happen.
//
// A tool's error fails the attempt rather than hand the error to the model:
// from then on the attempt stores nothing (its fence closes), and the next
// attempt resumes the turn, in which OpenCode gives the cut-off call an
// "interrupted" result and the model makes it again under a new id.
//
// A provider's outage never ends the turn: OpenCode asks the model again,
// as its `session.retry` hook decides (`retryPlugin`: pi's backoff, not
// before the provider's `retry-after`), and an outage it would retry for the
// last time, or stops retrying (timeouts), fails the attempt instead, as a
// tool's error does: the next attempt resumes the turn. A refusal is never
// asked again, and ends the turn (424).
//
// A message steered to the turn (the agent's `steer` view, ../steering.ts)
// is submitted to OpenCode as a tool call of a round returns, before the
// round's next step: with `delivery: 'steer'`, which joins the turn at that
// step, after the round's results. Once, by its steer id (`msg_steer_<id>`,
// which OpenCode takes once, also from a retried attempt). In such a turn,
// the tool's `execute.after` hook, which OpenCode awaits before it stores the
// result, copies the result as the tool returned it and publishes the call's
// end, whose answer lists the messages, then submits them: so OpenCode places
// them at the step that follows, never past the turn's end. The copy stores
// each as a steered message of the turn, in its place, and tells the
// companion it is taken.
//
// v1 leaves out OpenCode's background work: its subagent and question tools,
// and background shell jobs.
//
// With a workspace, an ask of OpenCode's permission rules (a read of `.env`,
// by default) is denied, as OpenCode denies one nobody is present for; with
// `approval`, its tool call waits for a person's approval, through Restate
// (`permissionPlugin`).
//
