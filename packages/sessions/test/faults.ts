// Fault injection for crash tests: with ABORT_PER_MILLE, the process aborts
// at random requests of the objects' stores to Restate; and with ABORT_AT, at
// that request (counted from 1), so that it aborts at least once. ABORT_SEED
// seeds the random aborts: a process given the same seed aborts at the same of
// its requests (the requests themselves depend on timing). With
// ABORT_AFTER_MS, the random aborts start only once the process has run that
// long: the process-wide rate of ABORT_PER_MILLE is per request of every
// invocation the process runs, so under enough load a process dies before an
// attempt longer than a few requests can finish, and its retries, which make
// more requests, bring the next abort sooner. A lifetime floor bounds how
// often a process dies whatever the load. ABORT_AT is not held back by it.
//
// A request is what an attempt awaits of Restate: a read (`get`), the state's
// keys (`keys`), a sync. It aborts before each, and after a sync too: a
// commit stored, and the attempt killed before it awaits anything more.
// Writes (`set`, `clear`) are commands the SDK sends with the next request,
// so killing the process between two of them is killing it before that
// request: they are no abort points of their own. As they were, a commit
// that writes many keys (a checkpoint, deleting a long tail) rolled for an
// abort at each write, twice, and hardly ever survived; a key whose every
// commit is one could not commit at all.
